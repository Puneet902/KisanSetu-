# Krishi Mitra - Mobile Scaffold

This folder contains a minimal Expo React Native scaffold converted from the web project to start iterative conversion.

Quick start (requires Node.js and Expo CLI):

1. Open terminal in this folder:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\BOINA PUNEET\Downloads\copy-of-copy-of-krishi-mitra-ai (4)\mobile"
npm install
npm run start
```

2. Use Expo Go or run on emulator:

```powershell
npm run android
npm run ios
```

Notes:
- This is a scaffold with `Onboarding`, `Login`, and `Home` screens and a simple `BottomNav`.
- Remaining web components and services still live in the parent project; they can be copied into `mobile/` gradually, keeping logic unchanged.
